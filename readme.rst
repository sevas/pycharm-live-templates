What is this?
=============

Pycharm 3 live templates for:

* RestructuredText (``RST.xml``)


These should work with other intellij-based IDE, but I did not test it.


How to install?
===============

Copy these XML files to the live templates directory, and restart PyCharm.

* MacOS X: ``~/Library/Preferences/PyCharm30/templates/``
* GNU/Linux: ``~/.PyCharm30/config/templates``
* Windows Vista, 7 and above: ``C:\Users\$USER\.PyCharm30\config\templates``
* Windows XP, in case you are into these sort of things: ``C:\Documents and Settings\$USER\.PyCharm30\config\templates``
