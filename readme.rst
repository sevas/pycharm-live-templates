What is this?
=============

Pycharm 3.x (and above) live templates for:

* RestructuredText (``RST.xml``)
* Python (``Python.xml``)


These should work with other Intellij-based IDE, but I did not test it.


How to install?
===============

For PyCharm 4.x, copy these XML files to the live templates directory:

* MacOS X: ``~/Library/Preferences/PyCharm40/templates/``
* GNU/Linux: ``~/.PyCharm40/config/templates``
* Windows Vista, 7 and above: ``C:\Users\$USER\.PyCharm40\config\templates``
* Windows XP, in case you are into these sort of things: ``C:\Documents and Settings\$USER\.PyCharm40\config\templates``
